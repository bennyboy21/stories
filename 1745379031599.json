      "content": "Last Friday (April 11), two pastors in Gujarat, India, walked out of prison—free once again to share the gospel.\n\nBadri and Ramu* had been arrested earlier in the week, accused under anti-conversion laws often used to silence Christians who share the Gospel. These Indian pastors were freed by the end of the week—walking out of prison through prayer, solidarity, and the unshakable courage that defines the persecuted Church.\n\nAfter being forcibly taken from their ministry work by members of a Hindu nationalist group, the pastors were handed over to police, where they were reportedly beaten and later transferred to a long-term prison facility. There, they waited for justice—isolated, hurting, but not alone.\n\nWhen we learned about Badri and Ramu’s tragic situation, our team at Global Christian Relief wanted to help. Our team did what our donors do every day, we refused to let Badri and Ramu’s pain go unanswered. We collected the money among ourselves for the bail that ensured their release.\n\nJust a few days later, we received word that Badri and Ramu had been released.\n\nThese pastors—unjustly imprisoned—are now free and continuing their Gospel ministry, supported by faithful believers in their local community.\n\nThis is what it means to be one Church, one family. When one part of the Body suffers, we all can do our part to respond.\n\nThese pastors stood firm under pressure, trusting God even from a prison cell. Today, they remain committed to leading others to Christ, no matter the cost.\n\nTheir story is a real-time reminder of how urgent needs arise in the lives of persecuted believers—and how the GCR community responds together with compassion and action."
